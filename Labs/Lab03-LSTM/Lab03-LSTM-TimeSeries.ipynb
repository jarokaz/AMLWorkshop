    "[Solar power forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_forecasting) is a challenging and important problem. The solar energy generation forecasting problem is closely linked to the problem of weather variables forecasting. Indeed, this problem is usually split into two parts, on one hand focusing on the forecasting of solar PV or any other meteorological variable and on the other hand estimating the amount of energy that a concrete power plant will produce with the estimated meteorological resource. In general, the way to deal with this difficult problem is usually related to the spatial and temporal scales we are interested in. This tutorial focusses on a simplified forecasting model using previously generated data from solar panel to predict the future. \n",

    "Using historic daily production of a solar panel, we want to predict the total power production of the solar panel array for a day. We will be using the LSTM based time series prediction model to predict the daily output of a solar panel based on the initial readings of the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We train the model with historical data of the solar panel. In our example we want to predict the total power production of the solar panel array for the day starting with the initial readings of the day. We start predicting after the first 2 readings and adjust the prediction with each new reading.\n",

    "#### Training / Testing / Validation data preparation\n",
    "We start by reading the csv file for use with Tensorflow.  The raw data is sorted by time and we should randomize it before splitting into training, validation and test datasets but this would make it impractical to visualize results in the tutorial. Hence, we split the dataset in the following manner: pick in sequence, 8 values for training, 1 for validation and 1 for test until there is no more data. This will spread training, validation and test datasets across the full timeline while preserving time order.\n"
